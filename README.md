# 🛡️ Fraudulent Job Detector — Web Frontend  
---

**Live demo:** *Coming soon*  
**Backend repo:** [Fake Job Detector Backend](https://github.com/Buberwa-J/Fradulent-Jobs-Detector-With-Sentence-Transformers-Paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2.git)

## 🚀 Overview

This is the **frontend interface** for the **Fraudulent Job Detection System** — a machine learning–powered tool designed to evaluate the authenticity of job descriptions. With scams becoming increasingly deceptive, this tool offers job seekers an extra layer of protection by giving them fast and easy access to fraud predictions.

The design is sleek, responsive, and minimal — focused on **user experience** and **clarity of purpose**. It was originally built using the [Trust Hire Template](https://github.com/TailGrids/play-tailwind) by TailGrids, but has been significantly customized to fit the messaging and structure of this project.

## 🌐 What This Website Does

The website is split into two core pages:

1. **Landing Page**  
   Introduces the system to users with clear, concise sections about what the platform does, who it's for, and why it matters. It also includes visual cues and brief walkthroughs of the model’s predictions, building trust with users while giving them a quick overview of how the detection works.

2. **Job Description Analyzer Page**  
   This page offers a **simple form** where users can paste a job description. Upon submission, it communicates with the backend system and returns a **fraud probability score**, visually represented for clarity. It aims to be intuitive, fast, and reliable — no sign-ups, no distractions.
